  "Dispatch tests for the registry-only router.

  Stub handlers on purpose. Upstream's suite drove the real
  s3/ipfs/atproto/git handlers through the router — which is the coupling
  that kept six surfaces in one repository. What core owns is the dispatch
  decision: which host label wins, which injected mount is checked first,
  which built-in prefix falls back, and what an absent surface does. The
  cross-surface integration test that drives real handlers stays in the
  `kotobase-protocols` facade, which still depends on all of them.

  Labels are strings and `:path-surfaces` is `{prefix label}` — the same ctx
  shape the facade takes, so a shell can move between the two by changing a
  dependency rather than a call."
